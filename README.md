# ERNI Bootcamp Hackathon 2025: Code. Solve. Get hired.

## About The Hackathon

This 3-day onsite hackathon is for fresh graduates and aspiring developers looking to kickstart their tech careers. It’s part of ERNI’s hiring process for our Bootcamp Program.

You’ll work solo or in a small team to solve a real-world problem using AI. Choose a challenge in one of four areas: healthcare, fintech, transportation, or cybersecurity. You can use any tech stack you’re comfortable with, but your solution must include an AI tool, like a language model, AI API, or automation framework.

Throughout the event, ERNI engineers and leaders will be around to guide, observe, and give feedback. The goal isn’t just to code, it’s to show how you think, collaborate, and build something that works.

At the end, a panel of judges will review your project based on four things: technical complexity, maturity, creativity, and how well you present your idea. Top performers may be invited to join the ERNI Bootcamp and move one step closer to becoming part of the team.

## Timeline

* **Start Date and Time:** 23rd July 2025 at 09:00 AM EST
* **End Date and Time:** 25th July 2025 at 11:00 AM EST

## Tracks

* Healthcare

> Use AI to make healthcare easier for Filipinos. You can build something to check symptoms, assist barangay health workers, or organize patient info for clinics. The goal is to make health services easier to access, especially in communities that need it most.

* Transportation

> Look for ways to make moving people or goods more efficient. You might work on delivery planning, flight scheduling, or cargo tracking. It could be something that helps drivers save time, businesses lower costs, or travelers avoid delays. Focus on real issues in transport, whether it’s daily operations or large-scale logistics.

* Financial Technology

> Reshape finance using AI in this track. Your goal is to create smarter, more accessible, and secure financial services, spanning everything from payments to investments. We're seeking AI-driven solutions for fraud detection or risk assessment, machine learning for personalized finance or investment strategies, and intelligent systems for banking, payments, or financial inclusion.

* Cybersecurity

> Protect our digital world with AI. Build advanced, intelligent solutions to combat cyber threats, enhance data privacy, and secure systems. We're looking for AI-powered tools for threat detection or anomaly analysis, machine learning for malware analysis or predictive security, and intelligent automation for incident response or vulnerability management.
